	<p>ON THE GRID is a website, built to increase the networking among college students. It presents a unique platform where the students can make use of various Intra-college features like: -
	<ul>
		
		<li>File sharing:  Students can make use of cloud media sharing and embedded media content</li>
		<li>Social Networking:  Students can socialise with other students with a better chance of actually meeting and interacting with them</li>
		<li>Informative chat forums:  Junior students can take advices from their seniors regarding their courses; students can discuss about their projects; academic as well as non-academic queries can also be discussed </li>
		<li>Online competitions: For instance, hack-a-thons, time-bound coding contests, art competions.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p>OTG would not be bound to only a single college's network. It aims to expand the grid to as many colleges as possible, thus increasing the reach and opportunities available to the students. Multiple individual college networks combine to form an ultimate network where students can interact, learn, share and grow. Inter-college online contests would help in building a healthy competition among the students and an online ranking will keep the track of all the activities and rank all the colleges based on their performances. </p>
	<p>The initial format of the OTG website is planned to be based on a hierarchy which would consist of multiple grids of various types: - </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Every individual student will have his/her own grid consisting of students he/she already knows and/or someone they reached to using OTG. </li>
		<li>Students will also be the part of their own college's grid.</li>
		<li>Colleges will be part of regional grids to have better statistical reports in the overall college rankings. </li>
		<li>Special grids can be made available for certain fields (e.g. technology, music, etc.)</li>
		<li>The accessible and available features would differ with different types of grids.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This website would open up a whole new world of opportunities for the aspiring students, give them an important platform for their overall development, and carve a niche for themselves On The Grid.
